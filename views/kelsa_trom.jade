		<br> "Stay Indoors," the safety alert we hear on smoggy days, always struck me as a strange order. 
		<br> On the one hand, it never feels plausible that the air outside could be very different from the 
		<br> air inside - or that air could be controlled at all. Even stronger is the physical perplexity 
		<br> of breathing, of not being able to do anything but breathe, within and despite dangerous conditions. 
		<br> This series identifies indoor enclosures that, by their appearance and function, promise the clean 
		<br> state of controlled air, imagined or not. Within these spaces, the mechanisms of tidiness and 
		<br> control break down through materials in the air; in this case, sounds.
