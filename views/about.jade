				p SMOG was conceived in a double dream. 
				br
				p SMOG is a zine in the form of a multi-tabbed browser window. Instead of our atomized, everyday browsing habits, SMOG is a curated cluster of related things, held together by mysterious forces, sideways handshakes and (missed) connections. Like a zine, which mashes aesthetics and ideas together to create a piecey whole, each tab is made independently and then brought together by the browser. SMOG is released three times a year.
