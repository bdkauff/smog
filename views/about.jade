				p SMOG was conceived in a double dream. 
				br
				p SMOG is a zine in the form of a multi-tabbed browser window. Unlike regular atomized browsing, each issue of SMOG is a curated cluster of related particles encircling a common theme. The structure of SMOG is meant to take advantage of the metonymic nature of links, mashing together aesthetics and ideas to create a piecey whole.  
				br
				p SMOG is released three times a year.
