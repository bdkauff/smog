					p The first version of the Wikipedia article on former President George W. Bush was published on August 9, 2002. Since then, the page has been revised over 45,000 times, as editors quarreled over descriptions of the War on Terror and Hurricane Katrina, and Wikipedia's own &ldquo;bot&rdquo; accounts conducted automated upkeep. The current, finely tuned version looks almost nothing like the original, which contains such sentences as &ldquo;The English press  (anywhere else too?) tends to nickname him 'Dubya', [sic] on account of his pronunciation of the middle initial of his name.&rdquo; 

					p But across those 45,000 edits, a handful of words and phrases have persisted. Specifically, they have persisted without alteration or added links in the paragraphs where they were originally placed. Excluding articles, conjunctions and other minor words, as well as repeats and words in the page's title, this is the complete list of those enduring pieces:
						br
						br
						em Walker. Born July 6. President of the United States of America. Texas. States. The United States.

					p It turns out that nearly all of Wikipedia's most edited articles have between one and ten of these residual words and phrases, which have managed to survive over the past decade through tens of thousands of edits. These particulates are their parent article's &ldquo;edit smog,&rdquo; which no amount of cleansing has managed to remove, and which will likely remain until an editor specifically seeks to remove them. George W. Bush's page is the most edited article on the English language Wikipedia, and below is the edit smog of the rest of the top 50. 
					p The page with the most edit smog, incidentally, is the article on Global Warming.
